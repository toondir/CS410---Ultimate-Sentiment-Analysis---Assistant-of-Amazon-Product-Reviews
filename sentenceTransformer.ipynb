However, for about thirty bucks, it's perfect for a novice like me. I take a lot of digital photos and most are pretty lousy. I am still learning all the features and functions, but I do have to say that I've made some pics a bit better. It's also easier to crop and resize than in other applications that I have, but I'm not sure that's enough to warrant a 30 dollar purchase.\n",
